They make their paneer in house!!!! Oh and their rice is perfect. Gorgeous fluffy endlessly long grains. Had the lamb saag, saag paneer, garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, veg samosa, lamb samosa (never seen this before, basically stuffed with lamb biryani-incredible,) and the veggie pakoras. Everything was great. Best apres ski dinner imaginable.',
